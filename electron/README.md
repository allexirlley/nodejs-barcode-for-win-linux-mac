# Native Desktop Barcode Reader

The sample demonstrates how to create a native desktop barcode reader based on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `index.htm` - A web page to render.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML.
- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Build [dbr.so](https://github.com/yushulx/nodejs-barcode-for-win-linux-mac).
2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the application:

    ```
    npm start
    ```
